   <p>The first thing that I love to do aka hobby is to play football.
    On a regular basis me and my team play futsal. I have loved this since my childhood.
    Even during my school days I played football for my school team and got a wonderful 
    opportuinity to go to India and play against one of their school team. When playing 
    football even if tired gives me the sensation of being overwhelmed by my own spirit.
    I give my best in every game may it be friendly-game or against a actual opponent.

    <p>The 2nd thing that I love to do the most is to ride a bike. I love riding bike since 8 grade. 
        I learned it from my father.
        Every week on saturday or after coming home from college I go for a bike ride with my friends.
        Riding a bike gives me a completely different 
        and satisfactory feeling of self-love and freedom.</p>
